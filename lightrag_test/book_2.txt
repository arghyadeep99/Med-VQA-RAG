A myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart muscle is blocked. This blockage is usually due to a buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries.

Symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and sweating. Immediate treatment involves restoring blood flow, typically using clot-busting drugs or coronary angioplasty. Long-term management includes antiplatelet drugs, statins, lifestyle changes, and cardiac rehabilitation.

Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. Long-term hypertension can cause severe health complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. It is often called the "silent killer" because it may not show any symptoms.

The condition is diagnosed when blood pressure readings consistently exceed 140/90 mmHg. Lifestyle changes such as reducing salt intake, increasing physical activity, and managing stress are the first line of treatment. In some cases, medications like ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics are prescribed.

Chronic kidney disease is the gradual loss of kidney function over time. It is commonly caused by diabetes and hypertension. Symptoms may not appear until the disease is advanced and can include fatigue, swelling, and changes in urination.

Diagnosis involves blood tests (creatinine, eGFR), urine tests, and imaging. Management includes controlling underlying conditions, dietary restrictions, and in late stages, dialysis or kidney transplantation.
