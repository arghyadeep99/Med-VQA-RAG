Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty breathing. Common triggers include allergens, cold air, exercise, and respiratory infections.

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. It is treated using inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and avoiding known triggers. Asthma action plans help patients manage their condition effectively.
