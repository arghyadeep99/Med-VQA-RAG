Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. It leads to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. Risk factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and genetic predisposition.

Management of type 2 diabetes includes dietary control, regular exercise, oral hypoglycemic agents such as metformin, and sometimes insulin therapy. Long-term complications include neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease.
