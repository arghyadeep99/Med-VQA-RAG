-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is English. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is English., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Example 1:

text:
Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. Long-term hypertension can cause severe health complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. It is often called the "silent killer" because it may not show any symptoms.

The condition is diagnosed when blood pressure readings consistently exceed 140/90 mmHg. Lifestyle changes such as reducing salt intake, increasing physical activity, and managing stress are the first line of treatment. In some cases, medications like ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics are prescribed.

Example 2:

text:
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. It leads to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. Risk factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and genetic predisposition.

Management of type 2 diabetes includes dietary control, regular exercise, oral hypoglycemic agents such as metformin, and sometimes insulin therapy. Long-term complications include neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease.
