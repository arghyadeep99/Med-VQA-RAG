## Causes of Asymmetrical Breasts

Asymmetrical breasts can arise from a variety of factors, which may be congenital, hormonal, surgical, or related to underlying health conditions. Understanding these causes is essential for individuals who may be concerned about breast asymmetry, as some factors may require medical evaluation.

### Congenital Conditions

Congenital conditions, such as Poland syndrome, can lead to underdevelopment of breast tissue on one side, resulting in noticeable asymmetry. This condition is characterized by the absence of certain muscles on one side of the body, which may also affect breast development.

The lungs are primarily responsible for gas exchange, allowing oxygen to enter the bloodstream and carbon dioxide to be expelled. Evaluations of the lungs in the reports indicate various conditions that may affect their function. For instance, assessments have been made for pleural effusions, pneumothorax, and lung opacities. Reports consistently mention normal lung volumes, which suggest healthy lung function in some cases, while other reports indicate the presence of pleural effusions or increased opacity, which may signify underlying issues such as pneumonia or fluid accumulation.

The heart's primary function is to pump blood throughout the body, and its health is often assessed through the size and silhouette observed in imaging studies. The reports indicate that the cardiac silhouette is frequently described as normal or unremarkable, suggesting that there are no significant abnormalities detected in the heart's size or shape.",Heart 	lungs,0.9275925780482815,0.5,True,"The actual output correctly identifies the heart and lungs as the major organs, aligning with the expected output.
