 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with asthma and RUL lung changes  // assess for
 pneumonia      assess for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and no
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  No pneumonia, vascular congestion,
 or pleural effusion.
 Nodular opacification is again seen the in the right mid zone laterally, which
 is been present at least since the earlier study of ___.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Productive cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is an inferolateral consolidation in the
 right upper lobe consistent with pneumonia.  Elsewhere the lungs appear clear.
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidation in the right upper lobe consistent with pneumonia.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough. Evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are new heterogeneous interstitial opacities in the right mid and lower
 lung, which do not appear to be confined to one lobe.The cardiac, hilar and
 mediastinal contours are normal.No pleural abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous opacities in the right mid and lower lung are compatible with
 pneumonia. Given the history of gastrointestinal symptoms, Legionella
 pneumonia is a possibility.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There
 is no pulmonary edema. Consolidative opacities are seen within the left lower
 lobe and right upper lobe compatible with multifocal pneumonia. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Surgical anchors are seen within the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal pneumonia. Follow up radiographs after treatment are recommended to
 ensure resolution of this finding.

 reflecting pneumonia.  Much of the residual could merely reflect fibrous

 The remainder of the study is unchanged with no evidence of focal
