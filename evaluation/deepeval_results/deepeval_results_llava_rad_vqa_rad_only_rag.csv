enhanced,GEval,test_case_0,True,What organ system is being imaged?,The organ system being imaged is the chest. The study was performed to assess for pneumonia. The patient is status post EBUS. The right lower lobe opacity is due to known mass and nodules seen on CT. The pre-existing right upper lobe pneumonia has only minimally decreased and continues to be clearly visualized in the right upper lobe. No new parenchymal opacities. No pleural effusions.

 effusion.  There is subsequent right basilar atelectasis.  The lung parenchyma
 shows no evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Normal size of the hilar structures.  Minimal deviation of
 the trachea to the right may be caused by retrosternal goiter.",right,0.7812881841609409,0.5,True,"The actual output correctly identifies the right hemidiaphragm as elevated, aligning with the expected output.
