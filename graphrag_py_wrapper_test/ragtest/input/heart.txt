A myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart muscle is blocked. This blockage is usually due to a buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries.

Symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and sweating. Immediate treatment involves restoring blood flow, typically using clot-busting drugs or coronary angioplasty. Long-term management includes antiplatelet drugs, statins, lifestyle changes, and cardiac rehabilitation.
