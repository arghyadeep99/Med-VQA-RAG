Chronic kidney disease is the gradual loss of kidney function over time. It is commonly caused by diabetes and hypertension. Symptoms may not appear until the disease is advanced and can include fatigue, swelling, and changes in urination.

Diagnosis involves blood tests (creatinine, eGFR), urine tests, and imaging. Management includes controlling underlying conditions, dietary restrictions, and in late stages, dialysis or kidney transplantation.
