Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. Long-term hypertension can cause severe health complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. It is often called the "silent killer" because it may not show any symptoms.

The condition is diagnosed when blood pressure readings consistently exceed 140/90 mmHg. Lifestyle changes such as reducing salt intake, increasing physical activity, and managing stress are the first line of treatment. In some cases, medications like ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics are prescribed.
