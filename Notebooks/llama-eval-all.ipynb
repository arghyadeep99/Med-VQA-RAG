The image only shows the left lung, with no visible signs of pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. The heart size is normal, and the mediastinum appears stable. The lungs are essentially clear, with no signs of acute pneumonia or pleural effusion.\n5\nThe abnormal organ system in this image is the cardiovascular system, specifically the left ventricle, which appears prominent. The heart size is normal, but the left ventricle prominence suggests possible cardiac dysfunction or enlargement.\n10\nBased on the provided image and context, the patient is oriented in the supine position, as indicated by the presence of the sternum and the orientation of the ribs and other bony structures. The image shows a normal cardiac silhouette, suggesting that the patient is lying on their back. The absence of any significant abnormalities in the mediastinum or hilar regions further supports this orientation.\n14\nThis image is a chest radiograph, specifically a portable anterior-posterior (AP) view, which is a standard radiographic examination used to evaluate the lungs, heart, and other chest structures. The image is taken with the patient standing and facing the radiographic equipment, and it is used to assess the lungs, heart, and other chest structures for abnormalities such as pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. The image is typically taken in a hospital or medical setting and is used to help diagnose and manage various medical conditions.\n18\nThe lung abnormalities observed in the image are characterized by multiple ill-defined opacities throughout the right and left lung, which are likely indicative of multifocal pneumonia. The cardiac silhouette has enlarged compared to a previous examination, and there are two subcentimeter rounded opacities seen in the left mid-lung, which may have been present on the prior radiograph. The pulmonary vasculature appears normal, and no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visible. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal, and there are no acute osseous abnormalities present. The findings suggest a multifocal pneumonia, with the two subcentimeter rounded opacities in the left mid-lung potentially representing a persistent or recurring infection.\n65\nThe provided image is a chest X-ray, which reveals severe hyperinflation and abnormality in the lungs. The right pleural effusion is no longer present, and there is a moderate interstitial abnormality responsible for large-scale bronchiectasis and nodulation. The mass-like elliptical lesion at the right lung apex is long-standing and does not raise concern for malignancy. There has been no worsening since the last examination, and the heart size is normal. The pulmonary arteries are chronically enlarged, reflecting pulmonary arterial hypertension. The lungs are severely hyperinflated and severely abnormal, with a moderate right pleural effusion no longer present. There is a severe interstitial abnormality responsible for large-scale bronchiectasis and nodulation, but compared to the previous examination, there has been improvement, and there has been no worsening since the last examination. The mass-like elliptical lesion at the right lung apex is long-standing and does not raise concern for malignancy, nor is there\n66\nBased on the provided radiograph, there is a notable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, suggesting potential complications such as a liver or spleen issue. The linear density projecting over the right mid-lung is indicative of atelectasis or scarring, which may be related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other lung conditions. Additionally, the left subclavian Port-A-Cath is in its expected location, indicating proper placement and function.\n\nIn contrast, the second radiograph shows an increased linear lucency under the left hemidiaphragm, which could represent a small amount of free intraperitoneal air. This finding is supported by minimal hyperlucency below the right hemidiaphragm. The cardiac silhouette appears normal in size, and there are no pleural effusions, pneumothorax, hilar, or mediastinal abnormalities.\n\nThe third radiograph shows a substantial elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour, with mild atelectatic\n67\nThe abnormality by the right hemidiaphragm is likely due to a small amount of free intraperitoneal air, as indicated by the linear lucency seen under the left hemidiaphragm and the minimal hyperlucency below the right hemidiaphragm. This finding is supported by the comparison to the previous radiograph, which showed an increased linear lucency under the left hemidiaphragm. The presence of this free air may be related to the patient's history of Nissen fundoplication and the recent onset of right upper quadrant pain and shortness of breath.\n68\nThis image is a chest radiograph, specifically a PA (posteroanterior) and lateral view, showing a moderate right pleural effusion with an apparent decrease in size since the previous radiograph. The lung volumes are lower, exaggerating the increase in mild cardiomegaly. Atelectasis at the right lung base is new, and upper lungs are clear. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.\n75\nThe cavitary lesion is located in the right upper lobe, specifically in the area surrounding the fiducial marker. This lesion appears as a ground-glass opacity and may be consistent with an infectious process, such as pneumonia. The presence of rib fractures on the left and right, as well as hyperinflation, suggests that the patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The resolution of the left lower lobe opacity is consistent with the resolution of an infectious process or aspiration. A follow-up examination after completion of antibiotic therapy is recommended to document the resolution of the right upper lobe opacity.\n76\nThe abnormality is located in the right upper lobe, characterized by minimal scarring at the bases of the upper lobes, and questionable atelectasis or pleural scarring. The mediastinum and hilar contours are normal, with no evidence of active infection or pulmonary edema. The right upper lobe opacities project over the medial head of the clavicle, potentially representing parenchymal or pleural abnormalities. The multiple rib fractures on the left are noted with associated pleural scarring, but there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The absence of prior imaging and the presence of these changes suggest that a chest CT might be considered.\n77\nThe organ primarily evaluated in this image is the lungs, specifically the right lower lobe and right middle lobe, which appear to have consolidations or atelectasis. The presence of a moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is also noted. The left lung appears clear, and there is no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease or rib fracture. The heart size is normal, and the mediastinum is normal. The findings suggest an infectious process, such as pneumonia, and the presence of atelectasis and pleural effusion.\n78\nThe organ system imaged is the chest, which includes the heart, lungs, and surrounding structures. The radiograph shows a normal-sized heart, clear lungs, and no signs of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The mediastinum and hilar contours are also normal. However, there are some degenerative changes noted throughout the thoracic spine with large osteophyte formation.\n80\nThis image is a frontal chest radiograph, which is a standard view used to evaluate the lungs and heart. The image is taken in the anteroposterior (AP) plane, which is the most common plane used for chest radiographs. The AP plane is taken with the X-ray beam directed from front to back, resulting in a clear view of the lungs, heart, and mediastinum.\n82\nThe hila appear abnormal, with a notable increase in pulmonary vascular congestion compared to the previous study. This is evident from the comparison with the study of ___, which showed a decrease in pulmonary vascular congestion, suggesting slightly improved lung volumes. However, the current study reveals no acute cardiopulmonary disease, pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. The heart size remains top normal, and the mediastinum is stable. The left subclavian line tip terminates at the level of mid SVC, and parenchymal opacities are present, most likely due to an infectious etiology.\n83\nThe right lung exhibits a moderate pleural effusion and volume loss, accompanied by an opacified right lung mass. Notably, the lung apices appear relatively clear. The presence of a moderate right pleural effusion and volume loss at the right base is evident, with the heart shifted to the right due to volume loss in the right lower lung. The lung apices are relatively clear, and there is no large pneumothorax. The impression suggests a moderate right pleural effusion and volume loss at the right base, with mediastinal shift to the right. Cavitation in the right lung mass is better appreciated on recent CT.\n85\nThe finding in the right lung is a consolidation with a mass and collapse involving a greater portion of the right upper lobe, accompanied by an increase in small pleural effusion. The consolidation appears to have increased in size compared to the previous radiograph, and the right upper lobe opacity seems to have increased in size. The left lung is essentially clear, and the heart and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. The patient has a history of a lump over the right pec, and the radiograph suggests a reaccumulation of fluid in the right pleural space. The anterior thoracic wall is mildly more prominent than on the earlier exam, which could be correlated to the soft tissue mass felt on the patient's chest. However, the radiograph is a poor test for this. The patient has had a right middle and lower lobectomy, and the appearance of the lung parenchyma is not significantly changed from the prior examination. There is likely some atelectasis at the right\n86\nThe lung apices exhibit abnormalities, characterized by a calcified granuloma on the left and scarring in both upper lobes, indicative of emphysema and overinflation. These findings are consistent with the patient's history of COPD and HIV, and are not associated with acute infection or pulmonary edema.\n89\nThe lung apices show minimal scarring, with a calcified granuloma in the left lung apex. There is no evidence of active infection or pulmonary edema. The heart and mediastinum are normal in size, and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The lungs are hyperinflated, with small bilateral pleural effusions. The right-sided PICC is in the upper SVC, and there is no acute focal consolidation.\n90\nThe image provided is a chest X-ray of a patient with a history of altered mental status and suspected bilateral pneumonia. The radiologist's impression notes that the patient has overall improvement in bibasilar consolidations and bilateral pleural effusions, as well as vascular engorgement. The heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable with no new consolidations seen.\n\nThe patient has a history of tracheoplasty, and the radiologist notes that the heart size and mediastinum are stable, with no new consolidations seen. The lungs are essentially clear, but there is a loculated pleural effusion on the right, which is most likely a sequela of prior surgery.\n\nThe patient has a history of bronchiectasis from MAC, with intermittent hemoptysis and worsening dyspnea. The radiologist notes that the overall volume of abnormal lung has improved since the previous study, but there is still extensive bronchiectasis and peribronchial infiltration in\n91\nThe breasts are asymmetrical due to the presence of scarring in the right lung apex, as indicated by the radiographic findings of moderate overinflation, bilateral scarring at the lung bases, and minimal scars in the right lung apex. This suggests that the patient has had a history of cavitary TB and is nearing the end of treatment, with some residual bronchiectasis and peribronchial infiltration in the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The overall volume of abnormal lung has improved since the previous examination, but there are still areas of bronchiectasis and peribronchial infiltration. There is no evidence of acute lung disease such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.\n92\nThe aortopulmonary window appears normal, with no visible abnormalities or signs of disease. The mediastinal and hilar contours are also unremarkable, and there are no signs of pneumonia or other acute lung changes. The lungs are mildly hyperexpanded, which could be seen in the setting of asthma, but there are no other abnormalities or pathologies present.\n95\nThe aortopulmonary window appears normal, with no signs of pneumonia or mass. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable, and the lungs are mildly hyperexpanded but clear, without pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable, and there is no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. The lungs appear clear, and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The chest is hyperinflated, but no acute process is identified.\n96\nIn the aortopulmonary window of this image, I see a sign that is consistent with a normal finding, but it could also represent an early sign of pneumonia. The presence of this sign does not indicate any acute cardiopulmonary process or evidence of a displaced rib fracture. However, it is important to note that a dedicated rib series would be a more sensitive study for the detection of a rib fracture.\n97\nThe diffuse pleural thickening is located in the right hemithorax, extending from the apex to the base, and is best visualized on the lateral chest radiograph. The pleural thickening is seen as a smooth, linear opacity that encases the lung and extends into the minor fissure. The thickening is most pronounced in the upper part of the right hemithorax, where it forms a characteristic \"pleural tail\" sign. The pleural thickening is also seen to extend into the minor fissure, which is a normal anatomical structure that separates the upper and lower lobes of the lung. The thickening is not uniform and has a more pronounced appearance in the upper part of the right hemithorax, suggesting that it may be a reactive process rather than a primary pleural pathology.\n98\nThe abnormal lung is the right lung, which shows circumferential thickening of the pleura and a small amount of pleural fluid. The left lung appears normal.\n99\nThe catheter tip is located in the lower portion of the superior vena cava (SVC).\n102\nThe catheter tip extends into the cavoatrial junction, which is the junction between the superior vena cava and the right atrium of the heart.\n103\nThis image is a chest X-ray, specifically a posteroanterior (PA) view, which is a standard radiographic projection used to evaluate the lungs and chest cavity. The image is a radiograph, which is a type of medical imaging that uses X-rays to produce images of the internal structures of the body.\n104\nThis x-ray was taken in a portable anteroposterior (AP) position, as indicated by the label \"CHEST (PORTABLE AP)\" on the image. The image is a chest radiograph, which is a standard diagnostic tool used to visualize the lungs and surrounding structures. The x-ray was taken to evaluate the patient's lung condition, specifically to assess the presence or absence of a pneumothorax (air in the pleural space) and to monitor the re-expansion of the lung after the placement of a chest tube.\n107\nBased on the provided image and context, the ribs located near the abnormality seen in this image are the 9th right rib. The image shows a slight cortical step-off in the lateral aspect of the right 9th rib, which is likely a minimally displaced fracture. However, it is important to note that the chest radiograph is very limited in the evaluation of rib fractures, and further evaluation could be performed with a dedicated rib series with appropriate skin markers, if clinically indicated.\n108\nThe abnormality is located at the level of the right lung, specifically in the basal region, as indicated by the presence of mild right basal atelectasis. This finding is consistent with the provided context, which includes a series of chest radiographs taken for various indications, including pleuritic chest pain, asthma, and occult processes. The normal position of the hemidiaphragms and the absence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumonia further support this finding.\n109\nThe cardiac shadow is top-normal to mildly enlarged, which is of note in a patient of this age. The mediastinum is not widened.\n115\nBased on the provided image and context, there is a newly developed middle lobe pneumonia with multiple air bronchograms. The lung parenchyma is otherwise unremarkable, and there is no pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is of normal size. Additionally, there are bilateral basal and right upper lobe reticular opacities, which could be indicative of interstitial lung disease or mild interstitial edema. Further follow-up is recommended to assess these findings.\n119\nThe calcifications are located in the left hilus, which is the area of the chest where the lungs meet the heart and major blood vessels.\n121\nThe aortic arch is located in the upper part of the chest, just above the heart. It is a continuation of the aortic valve and is surrounded by the pulmonary arteries and veins. The aortic arch is responsible for supplying oxygenated blood to the brain, face, and upper extremities.\n122\nThe aortic arch is visualized on the right side of the image.\n123\nThe lung lesion is located in the right lung, specifically in the pleural region, and is described as a pleural lipoma. This is based on the comparison to a previous CT examination, which showed a similar lesion. The lesion is not associated with any acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, and the lung volumes are normal. The heart size is also within normal limits.\n124\nThe lesion is located in the right middle lobe of the lung.\n125\nBased on the provided image, there is one lesion present in the image, specifically an 8 mm pleural lesion located in the right lung, which is confirmed to be a pleural lipoma on further examination.\n127\nThe left lung is more clearly visualized compared to the right lung in this chest X-ray. The right lung shows a small right apical pneumothorax and a small dependent right pleural effusion, while the left lung appears essentially clear. The cardiac size is top normal, and the right Port-A-Cath tip is in the lower SVC. There is no pneumothorax on the left side, and the left lower lobe atelectasis has markedly improved. A small left effusion is present. Overall, the left lung is more clearly visualized than the right lung in this chest X-ray.\n129\nThe left lung is clearer than the right lung. The right lung has a loculated pleural effusion and an opacity in the right upper lobe, which could be a reaccumulation of fluid or a soft tissue mass. The left lung is essentially clear with no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.\n130\nThe two major organs present in this image are the lungs and the heart. The lungs are visible as two dark areas, one on each side of the heart, which is a lighter-colored structure in the center of the image. The lungs appear to be normal in size and shape, with no visible signs of disease or injury. The heart is also normal in size and shape, with no visible signs of disease or injury.\n131\nThe heart is of normal size compared to the thorax.\n135\nThe free air trapped subcutaneously in this image is located in the right lateral chest wall, specifically around the right third and fourth ribs. This is indicated by the linear scarring adjacent to the expansile lytic process in the right third and fourth ribs anteriorly.\n141\nThe lesion is located in the right upper lobe, as indicated by the unchanged calcified granuloma observed in the chest X-ray.\n146\nThe lesion is present in the left upper lung lobe.\n147\nThe aneurysm is located in the ascending aorta, as indicated by the provided image and context. The image shows a PA (posteroanterior) chest radiograph with an aneurysm visible in the ascending aorta, which is a common location for such abnormalities. The aneurysm appears to be similar in appearance compared to previous images, with no new abnormalities demonstrated.\n148\nThe most important abnormality found in this image is the presence of a left-sided aortic arch, which is a normal anatomical variation. This is evident from the normal cardiac and mediastinal contours, as well as the clear appearance of the lungs without any focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The absence of any acute cardiopulmonary process or abnormality makes this a normal finding for a healthy individual.\n149\nThe lesion is located at the 8th rib.\n150\nBased on the provided image and context, the lesion is located inferior to the right 8th rib.\n151\nThe cardiac border is more obscured on the right side.\n152\nThe cardiac border is more obscured on the right side. This is evident from the comparison between the two images, where the right cardiac border appears less defined and more indistinct compared to the left cardiac border.\n153\nThe cardiac border on the right side appears more prominent than the left, suggesting a possible abnormality or asymmetry in the chest cavity. This could be due to various factors such as a lung disease, an abnormality in the heart or mediastinum, or an asymmetrical chest cavity. However, without further information or comparison images, it is difficult to provide a more specific diagnosis.\n154\nThe cardiac border that is more prominently visualized is the right border. This is because the patient has taken a better inspiration, as indicated by the increased lung volumes, which enhances the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.\n155\nThe lung with more extensive infiltration is the right lung. The radiograph shows a widespread opacity in the right upper lobe, suggesting pneumonia, and a patchy opacity in the posterior right lower lobe, also worrisome for pneumonia. In contrast, the left lung appears clear. The presence of a small pleural effusion on the right only further supports the finding that the right lung has more extensive infiltration.\n158\nThe most infiltrates are located in the lingula and left lower lobe, with lesser involvement in the right lower lobe and both upper lobes.\n159\nThe largest air collection in this image is located in the right chest, specifically in the right lung, and is consistent with a pneumothorax. This is evident from the presence of a large air collection in the right hemithorax, which is a characteristic feature of a pneumothorax. The air collection is accompanied by a depression of the right hemidiaphragm, indicating tension. The presence of a chest tube and surgical chain in the right apex further supports the diagnosis of a pneumothorax.\n161\nThe lesion is located in the right upper lobe of the lung, specifically in the perihilar region. The lesion is described as a mass and is not significantly changed in size compared to the previous radiograph. The lungs are otherwise clear, and the heart size is normal. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.\n162\nThe primary lesion is located in the right lower lobe (RLL) of the lung, as indicated by the presence of a right hilar mass and perihilar opacity. The lesion is unchanged in appearance since the previous examination, and there are no new lung parenchymal findings. The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of the lower Superior Vena Cava (SVC), and the cardiomedial silhouettes are stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. The overall appearance is unchanged since the previous examination demonstrated.\n163\nThe subcutaneous air collection is located in the right chest, specifically in the subcutaneous soft tissues over the clavicle, as shown in the image. The catheter from a right chest Port-A-Cath courses in the subcutaneous soft tissues over the clavicle, then makes a 270-degree counterclockwise loop before extending inferiorly from the right IJ to the mid SVC. It is difficult to tell whether this loop is in the subcutaneous tissues or the right internal jugular vein.\n174\nThe opacity near the left lung apex appears to be a rounded mass, approximately 4.5 x 4.5 cm in size, located adjacent to the left hilus and concerning for malignancy. This finding is consistent with the patient's history of cough for three weeks and tobacco use, as well as the presence of a known left upper lobe mass that has been unchanged in the interval. The mass is likely a result of metastatic disease from the known malignancy, and further evaluation with chest CT is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of disease.\n177\nIn the left apex, there is a small to moderate-sized pneumothorax with a residual apical opacity. The left lung has multifocal opacities, and the right lung is clear of pneumonia. The heart size is normal, and there is severe biapical pleural calcification, which raises the possibility of prior tuberculosis.\n178\nThe lesion is located in the right upper lobe of the lung, specifically in the perihilar region. The lesion appears as a mass within the right upper lobe and right perihilar region, which has not significantly changed in size compared to the prior radiograph. The lungs are otherwise clear, and the heart size is normal. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax seen.\n180\nThe heart border obscured is the right side.\n181\nThis image is a chest radiograph, specifically a portable anteroposterior (AP) chest x-ray, taken to evaluate the lungs and heart of a patient with a port and central line. The image is compared to a previous study from the same day to assess for any changes or abnormalities. The findings include a new right IJ central line with the tip overlying the distal SVC, a relative paucity of vascular markings at the lung apices, and a focal opacity in the right upper lobe consistent with full consolidation and minimal atelectasis at the right and left lung bases. No new focal infiltrate or effusion is detected, and no CHF is noted. The impression is that the new right IJ line is present, and there is a relative paucity of vascular markings at the both lung apices, which is likely due to normal variation in this individual. The focal opacity in the right upper lobe is consistent with full consolidation and minimal atelectasis\n182\nThe lesion is located in the left upper lung, in a paramediastinal location, and has increased in size from 3.4 to 4.0 mm. The large right lower lobe lesions have also substantially increased in size and density. There is no evidence of pleural effusions, and the cardiac silhouette remains unchanged.\n183\nThe lesion is located in the right middle lobe of the lung.\n184\nThe most obscured area in the image is the right infrahilar opacity near the cardiophrenic angle, which is similar to the radiograph dated ___ and is overall within normal limits. The lungs are well-expanded, and there are no acute processes present. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is also within normal limits, with no pneumothoraces or pleural effusions seen. The pigtail catheter projects over the right upper abdomen, but there are no pneumothoraces. The right lower lobe opacity reflects a known right lower lobe mass seen on a chest CT, and there is a small right pleural effusion. The bony structures are unremarkable, and the lungs are clear without focal consolidation. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion, and no pneumothorax is seen. The right pleural effusion is persistent and stable since ___, with adjacent right lower and middle lobe relaxation atelectasis. The lungs are well-expanded, and there are no\n188\nThe lucency amid densities in the right lung is likely due to an increase in interstitial abnormality, presumably due to lymphatic congestion, as indicated by the provided context. This is supported by the comparison with prior chest radiographs, which show an increase in interstitial abnormality throughout the right lung and an increase in a moderate subpulmonic right pleural effusion. The left lung is clear, and there is a borderline cardiomegaly that is stable. The overall appearance is somewhat similar to the CT scout from ___, which demonstrated mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as well as chronic pulmonary thickening, most consistent with sarcoidosis.\n192\nThe nodule is located in the right upper lobe.\n193\nThe organ principally shown in this image is the lungs. This is evident from the shape and structure of the lungs, which are visible in the image. The lungs are a pair of organs located in the chest that are responsible for taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide through the process of breathing.\n197\nThis image is a chest radiograph taken in the posteroanterior (PA) plane, which is a standard view used to evaluate the lungs and heart. The PA plane provides a clear view of the lungs, heart, and diaphragm, making it an ideal choice for assessing respiratory and cardiac conditions.\n198\nThis image is a chest radiograph, specifically a PA (posteroanterior) view. It is a medical imaging test that uses X-rays to produce images of the chest and lungs. The radiograph is used to evaluate the lungs, heart, and other structures in the chest, and can help diagnose conditions such as pneumonia, heart disease, and lung cancer.\n199\nThe trachea appears to be compressed and displaced to the left, with a notable increase in the size of the right lung. This suggests that the patient has a significant right upper lobe lung abscess, which is causing the trachea to be pushed to the left. The presence of a right upper lobe consolidation and cavities further supports this finding.\n203\nThe wide undulations along the vertebral column are called scoliosis. Scoliosis is a medical term used to describe an abnormal curvature of the spine, which can be detected through X-ray imaging. In this case, the X-ray image shows a moderate degree of scoliosis, indicating a noticeable curvature of the spine.\n206\nThe trachea is deviated to the left, indicating a potential issue with the right lung or the structures surrounding it. This could be due to various factors such as an enlarged right lung, fluid buildup, or an obstruction in the right lung. It is essential to consult with a medical professional for a thorough evaluation and diagnosis.\n207\nBased on the provided images and context, it is likely that the patient is a female. The images show a history of breast cancer, with clips in the bilateral axilla, indicating that the patient has undergone mastectomies. The presence of these clips is a strong indicator of a female patient.\n218\nIn the provided image, a chest radiograph is presented, showcasing the thoracic cavity in the anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views. The examination was conducted to evaluate the chest for any abnormalities or signs of pneumonia, particularly in the context of a sickle cell crisis with inspiratory wheezing.\n\nUpon reviewing the image, the following findings are noted:\n\n* Cardiomegaly is mild, indicating a slightly enlarged heart.\n* The mediastinal contour appears normal.\n* The lungs are clear without any focal consolidation, large effusion, or pneumothorax.\n* Hilar configuration remains unchanged.\n* Bony structures appear intact.\n\nThese findings suggest that there is no acute cardiopulmonary process present, and the patient's chest appears normal in terms of lung and heart structure.\n235\nThe tip of the line in the provided image is located at the top left corner of the chest radiograph. The line appears to be a marker or a reference point used in the radiographic examination, possibly to indicate the position of the patient or to help with image orientation.\n252\nThe tip of the Port-a-Cath catheter is located in the mid portion of the Superior Vena Cava (SVC).\n253\nBased on the provided image and context, the pathology is described as follows:\n\nThe lungs are clear without any focal opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal, indicating no acute intrathoracic process. The heart is mildly enlarged, and the aorta is moderately tortuous. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature shows upper zone redistribution, suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension but no congestive heart failure. Moderate anterior osteophyte formation and mild narrowings among several mid-thoracic interspaces are noted. Overall, the findings suggest pulmonary venous hypertension but no definite acute process.\n271\nBased on the provided image and context, the pathology is likely to be a pericardial effusion or global cardiomyopathy, as indicated by the significant increase in heart size compared to previous studies. The lungs are clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion or edema. The mediastinal contours are normal, and the heart is moderately enlarged. The findings are consistent with a pericardial effusion or global cardiomyopathy, but further evaluation and diagnostic testing are necessary to confirm the exact nature of the pathology.\n272\nThe widening of the mediastinum is most likely caused by the presence of a large mediastinal lymph node mass, which is visible on the radiograph. This mass is likely to be a lymphoma, given the patient's history of asbestos exposure and the lack of any other acute cardiopulmonary process. The mass is causing the widening of the mediastinum, which is a characteristic feature of mediastinal lymphoma.\n277\nBased on the provided context and image, the widened mediastinum is caused by an interval increase in mediastinal caliber in the regions of both the ascending aorta and azygos vein, suggesting mediastinal venous engorgement.\n278\nThe pathology in the given image is related to the respiratory system, specifically the lungs. The presence of consolidation in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe, as well as the enlarged right hilus and right paratracheal area, suggest an infectious process such as pneumonia. Additionally, the abnormal contour at the level of the azygos vein and the presence of pleural effusion further support this diagnosis.\n280\nThe modality of the given image is a chest x-ray.\n281\nThe plane demonstrated in the image is the Posteroanterior (PA) plane, which is a common radiographic projection used to examine the chest. In this projection, the X-ray beam is directed from the posterior (back) to the anterior (front) of the chest, resulting in a frontal view of the lungs and heart. The PA plane is useful for evaluating the lungs, heart, and mediastinum, as well as detecting abnormalities such as pneumonia, pneumothorax, and cardiac enlargement.\n285\nThe cavitary lesion is located in the right upper lobe of the lung.\n286\nThe cavitary lesion is located in the right upper lobe of the lung.\n287\nThe pathology in this image is a normal chest X-ray with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease, pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. The lungs are clear, and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The patient's heart size is normal, and the mediastinum is normal. There is no evidence of lung contusion, pneumothorax, or skeletal insult. The patient's condition is stable, and there is little change from the previous study.\n290\nThe pathology shown in the image is a normal chest X-ray with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease, pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. The lungs are clear, and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal, and the mediastinum and hilar structures are unremarkable. This is consistent with the impression of no acute cardiopulmonary process.\n291\nThis radiograph is a chest PA (postero-anterior) image, which is a standard view of the chest taken from the front. It provides a clear view of the lungs, heart, and mediastinum (the area between the lungs). The image is used to evaluate the lungs for any abnormalities, such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The PA view is useful for detecting lung nodules, masses, and other abnormalities in the lungs.\n292\nThe pathology in this image is a normal chest X-ray with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease, pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. The lung volumes are normal, and the cardiac silhouette is normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal contours. There is no pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusions. The lungs are fully expanded and clear, and the pleural surfaces are normal. This is consistent with a normal chest X-ray in a healthy individual.\n297\nThe pathology demonstrated in the image is a normal chest radiograph, with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease, pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged, but there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. The lungs, hila, mediastinum, and pleural surfaces appear normal.\n298\nThe radiograph shows a normal-sized heart and lungs without any signs of acute cardiopulmonary disease, such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The mediastinum and hila are unremarkable, and there is no evidence of vascular congestion or free air below the right hemidiaphragm. The patient's history of heavy tobacco use and asthma is consistent with the radiographic findings, which show no focal consolidation or pleural abnormality. Overall, the radiograph suggests that the patient has no acute intrathoracic process.\n301\nBased on the provided images and context, the foreign body in the chest is likely a right upper lobe opacity, which may represent an infectious process or atypical infection. The opacity is suspected to be different from the previous study, indicating a possible change in the lung's condition. The rest of the lungs appear clear, with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax observed. A chest CT is recommended for precise characterization of the right upper lobe process.\n302\nThe plane of the given image is a Posteroanterior (PA) chest x-ray.\n303\nThe lesion is located in the right midlung field, as indicated by the calcified granuloma seen in the chest radiograph. This is a relatively well-circumscribed lesion in the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, which has developed between the previous studies and now measures 6.5-7.5 cm in diameter. It is probably a lung abscess, and may involve the pleura locally, although there is no pleural effusion or remote pleural abnormality. The lungs are otherwise clear, and the heart size is normal.\n308\nBased on the provided image and context, the pneumothorax is located on the left side of the chest. This is evident from the comparison to the previous radiograph, which shows the millimetric left apical pneumothorax to be unchanged. The presence of a zone of indistinct and very subtle parenchymal opacity, corresponding to the CT-confirmed contusion area, further supports this finding. Additionally, the left rib fractures are unchanged, and there is minimal atelectasis of lung parenchyma adjacent to the right heart border. No pleural effusions, pneumonia, or pulmonary edema are present. Overall, the findings indicate a stable pneumothorax on the left side of the chest.\n317\nThe rib that is fractured is the eleventh rib on the left side. The image shows a heterogeneous appearance of several ribs on both the left and right sides, suggestive of metastatic bone disease. The most ventral part of the tenth left rib shows a cortical discontinuity, potentially reflecting a pathologic fracture. No other fractures can be clearly identified.\n319\nThe image is a chest radiograph, specifically a posteroanterior (PA) chest radiograph. This type of imaging modality is commonly used in radiology to evaluate the lungs, heart, and surrounding structures. The PA chest radiograph is taken with the patient standing upright and facing the X-ray machine, with the X-ray beam directed from front to back. This technique is useful for visualizing the lungs, heart, and mediastinum, as well as any abnormalities such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, or cardiac enlargement.\n320\nOne organ system visible in this image is the Respiratory System, comprising the lungs and airways. The lungs appear clear, with no signs of pneumonia or consolidation. The cardiac size is normal, and the aorta is tortuous. The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). An opacity in the lower mid mediastinum with an air component is compatible with a hiatal hernia.\n322\nThe provided image is a chest radiograph, specifically a posteroanterior (PA) radiograph, which is a standard imaging modality used to visualize the lungs, heart, and mediastinum. This type of radiograph is commonly used in medical settings to assess lung and heart health, as well as to evaluate for any abnormalities such as pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. The PA radiograph is taken with the patient standing upright and facing the X-ray machine, with the X-ray beam directed from front to back. This technique provides a clear view of the lungs, heart, and mediastinum, making it an essential tool for diagnosing various respiratory and cardiac conditions.\n325\nThe left and right costophrenic angles differ in their appearance and significance. The left costophrenic angle appears normal, with no evidence of acute disease or pleural thickening. In contrast, the right costophrenic angle is blunted, suggesting some degree of pleural thickening. This is consistent with the previous radiographs, which showed a minimal pleural effusion and areas of plate-like atelectasis in the right lung. The left lung appears normal, with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease or old tuberculous disease. Overall, the radiographs suggest that the patient has made significant progress in recovering from their initial condition, with substantial improvement in the right lung and complete resolution of the soft tissue on the right.\n326\nThe thoracic mass is located on the right side of the image.\n330\nBased on the provided image and context, the diaphragm is elevated on the left side. This conclusion is supported by the comparison with previous studies, which show a slight improvement in the left pleural effusion, but an overall minimal interval change. The elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is also noted in the impression section, along with blunting of the costophrenic angle and streaks of atelectasis in the mid lung bilaterally.\n333\nBased on the provided images and context, the diaphragm on the left side is elevated. This is evident from the flattening of the left hemidiaphragm and blunting of the costophrenic angle, as seen in the radiographs.\n334\nThe image is a chest radiograph, which is a medical imaging test used to visualize the lungs and surrounding structures. The radiograph is taken in a posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral (LAT) view, which provides a comprehensive view of the chest cavity. The image shows the lungs, heart, and diaphragm, as well as any abnormalities or pathologies present in these structures. The radiograph is useful for diagnosing conditions such as pneumonia, heart disease, and lung cancer, among others.\n335\nThis image is a chest X-ray, specifically a PA (postero-anterior) view, which is a standard radiographic projection used to visualize the lungs and chest cavity. The image shows a large left pleural effusion, which is a collection of fluid in the pleural space surrounding the lungs, indicating that the patient has experienced a recurrence of effusion. The right lung appears clear, and there is no evidence of mediastinal shift or pulmonary vascular congestion. The image also shows an old healed rib fracture on the right side and a liver-shaped structure that could be a pathologic heart size.\n340\nThis image is a chest X-ray, specifically a posteroanterior (PA) and lateral view, obtained for a 30-year-old woman with pleural effusion. The image shows a large left pleural effusion with no appreciable mediastinal shift, indicating its slow accumulation. The right lung is grossly clear, and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. The image also shows a small right pleural effusion and a loculated left pleural effusion with small bubbles of gas. The right lung is largely atelectatic, and there is a mild to moderate rightward mediastinal shift. Overall, the image suggests that the patient has a large pleural effusion with some complications, such as loculation and gas bubbles, but no significant lung or mediastinal abnormalities.\n341\nThe air fluid level is located in the right lower lobe of the lung.\n346\nThe air fluid level is located in the left lung, as indicated by the opacities at the left base and the presence of a small left pleural effusion. This is a new finding compared to the previous examination, suggesting a possible increase in pleural effusion. The right lung is clear, and there is no pneumothorax detected on either side. The presence of a right tunneled pleural catheter and a left pigtail catheter explains the opacities at the right base and left base, respectively. Additionally, a trace subcutaneous air is seen between the right hemidiaphragm, which is likely due to a small amount of intraperitoneal air following abdominal surgery. Overall, the examination suggests that the patient has a small left pleural effusion and a possible increase in pleural effusion, but no pneumothorax or significant lung pathology.\n347\nThe image shows a chest radiograph with evidence of a pleural effusion, specifically a small bilateral pleural effusion with the left greater than the right. The findings indicate an increase in the small left pleural effusion with left basilar opacity, likely representing a combination of compressive atelectasis and pleural fluid, and superimposed infection cannot be excluded. The stable trace right pleural effusion and mild cardiomegaly are also noted. The lungs are moderately well-inflated, and there is no pulmonary edema. The image is compared to previous studies, showing an increase in the small left pleural effusion and a moderate right pleural effusion, with the left greater than the right. The findings are consistent with a pleural effusion, and further evaluation is recommended to determine the cause and extent of the effusion.\n348\nThe pleural effusion is located in the left side of the chest, with a moderate-sized collection of fluid visible on the radiograph. The effusion is situated in the costophrenic recess, which is the area between the lower border of the lung and the diaphragm. The effusion is more pronounced on the left side, with a smaller amount of fluid visible on the right side. The radiograph also shows signs of atelectasis, or collapse, of the left lower lobe, which may be related to the pleural effusion.\n349\nThe image is oriented with the patient's right side on the left and the patient's left side on the right. This is evident from the positioning of the heart and the diaphragm, which are typically seen on the left side of the chest in a normal radiograph. The presence of the right scapula on the left side also confirms this orientation.\n350\nThis X-ray is in the posteroanterior (PA) plane, which is a standard radiographic projection used to visualize the chest and lungs. The PA plane is the most common and widely used projection in chest radiography, providing a clear view of the heart, lungs, and mediastinum.\n351\nThe abnormal side is the left, as indicated by the large pleural effusion and compensatory collapse of the left lower lobe and lingula, resulting in a substantial increase in the left pleural effusion compared to the right.\n352\nThe left lung has a defect, as evidenced by the large left pleural effusion and the presence of atelectasis in the left lung, lower lobe, and lingula. The right lung is clear, and there is no evidence of right pleural abnormality or pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours on the left are obscured, while the right mediastinal contours are normal. The hila are also affected, with the left hila being obscured and the right hila being normal. Overall, the findings suggest a significant increase in the left pleural effusion and compensatory collapse of the left lower lobe and lingula.\n353\nThe provided image is a chest radiograph, which allows for the evaluation of the lungs, heart, and mediastinum. The lung fields are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or emphysema. A patchy opacity at the right base may represent infection or aspiration, while linear opacities in the right upper lung are due to scarring. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and the aortic knob is calcified. The absence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax is noted. The presence of a dense opacity overlying the aortopulmonary window could be related to calcified lymph nodes from prior granulomatous infection. Overall, the image suggests a complex pulmonary and cardiac pathology, requiring further investigation and comparison with prior films to establish a definitive diagnosis.\n354\nThis image is a chest radiograph, which is a medical imaging test that uses X-rays to produce images of the chest and lungs. The image shows the chest and lungs in a frontal view, with the heart and lungs visible. The image is used to diagnose and monitor various conditions, such as pneumonia, lung cancer, and heart disease.\n362\nThis image is a chest radiograph, which is a medical imaging test that uses X-rays to produce images of the lungs and surrounding structures. The image shows the lungs, heart, and other internal organs in a two-dimensional format, allowing for the visualization of any abnormalities or abnormalities.\n363\nThe hyperdense findings in the mediastinum are a normal heart size and cardiac contours, as well as a mildly tortuous descending thoracic aorta. These findings are consistent with a normal mediastinal anatomy and do not suggest any acute intrathoracic process.\n364\nIn this image, the hyperdense structures seen in the mediastinum are likely the surgical clips that were used during the patient's surgery. These clips are typically made of a dense material, such as stainless steel or titanium, and are designed to remain in place after the surgery to help prevent complications. The presence of these clips is a normal finding after thoracic surgery and is not typically a cause for concern.\n365\nThe abnormality seen above the heart on the patient's right side is a small left Morgagni hernia, which is a congenital anomaly where a portion of the left hemidiaphragm is not fully formed, allowing the abdominal contents to protrude into the chest cavity. This is a normal finding and not considered abnormal.\n366\nBased on the provided image and context, the bump seen above the heart on the patient's right side is most likely a normal anatomical structure, possibly the azygos vein. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the azygos vein is a normal anatomical structure that can be visualized on chest radiographs, and its size is within normal limits in this case. Additionally, the heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged, which could be related to the azygos vein's size. However, without further information or comparison images, it is not possible to provide a definitive diagnosis. Therefore, it is recommended to perform a non-emergent CT scan for further evaluation.\n367\nThe image is a chest X-ray, taken in the postero-anterior (PA) plane. This plane is the most common orientation for chest X-rays, providing a clear view of the lungs and heart.\n368\nThe lesion is located in the right lung, specifically in the posterior segment of the right lobe. It appears as a band-like region of heterogeneous opacification on the frontal view and is probably pneumonia. The lung volumes are normal, and there are no pleural effusions, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette, hilar and mediastinal structures, and pleural surfaces are also normal.\n371\nThe lesion is located in the mid right lung, lateral to the hilus on the frontal view.\n372\nThe mass in the right upper quadrant measures at least 4 cm, with vague borders, and is concerning for malignancy.\n373\nThe mass in the right upper quadrant measures approximately 4.3 cm in size.\n374\nThe biological sex of the patient is male.\n378\nThe imaging modality used to take this image is a chest radiograph, specifically a posteroanterior (PA) and lateral view. The image is a black-and-white X-ray photograph of the chest, showing the skeletal structure of the rib cage, spine, and other bones, as well as the soft tissues of the lungs, heart, and other organs. The image is taken from the front (PA) and side (lateral) to provide a comprehensive view of the chest cavity.\n382\nThe imaging modality used to acquire this picture is a radiograph, specifically a chest X-ray. This is evident from the mention of a \"Portable AP radiograph of the chest\" in the context, which indicates that the image was taken using X-ray technology to produce a radiograph of the chest.\n383\nThis image was taken as a portable upright chest radiograph, which is a type of X-ray that is taken while the patient is standing up and is often used in emergency situations or when a patient is unable to lie down. The image is a chest X-ray, which is a standard diagnostic test used to evaluate the lungs and heart. The image is taken to assess the lungs, heart, and chest cavity for any abnormalities, such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The image is usually taken with the patient standing up and the X-ray machine positioned behind them. The image is then displayed on a screen or printed out for further analysis.\n391\nThe imaging modality seen in the provided context is a chest radiograph, specifically a PA (posteroanterior) and lateral upright chest radiograph. The image shows a normal heart size, a normal mediastinum, and essentially clear lungs, with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The lungs are slightly hyperexpanded, but there is no acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. The image also shows anterior osteophytes of the thoracic spine, which are noted as extensive. Additionally, surgical clips are seen projecting over the left hemithorax, related to recent breast surgery, and the right breast clips are also visible, consistent with breast reconstruction.\n392\nThe organ system being imaged is the chest, specifically the lungs, with a focus on the right upper lobe. The radiographs show a large opacity in the right upper lobe, which is new since the last chest radiograph. There is no additional foci of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax present. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. No displaced rib fracture or osseous lesion is identified. The findings correlate with a known focus of non-small cell lung cancer.\n393\nThe image shows a chest radiograph with a higher density of masses in the right middle lobe compared to the left lower lobe. The right middle lobe has an especially large lesion, while the left lower lobe has multiple smaller metastases scattered throughout. The lungs are clear, with no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities or displaced rib fractures identified. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size, and there is minimal tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Overall, the radiograph suggests metastatic disease, with the right middle lobe being the most affected area.\n394\nThe upper lobe of the lung contains a higher density of masses, with multiple nodules of varying sizes, best identified in the left upper lung. These nodules appear more conspicuous than on the previous examination, suggesting a possible chronic infection or granulomatous exposure. The right upper lung nodule is smaller than on the comparison from earlier examinations. Overall, the impression is that the pulmonary nodules are likely stable and reflective of chronic infection or granulomatous exposure, but correlation with more recent previous imaging would be helpful to exclude any interim improvement and subsequent worsening.\n395\nThe abnormal mass is located in the right lower lobe of the lung.\n399\nThe abnormal mass is located within the right lung, specifically within the right middle lobe and the right lower lobe.\n400\nThe azygoesophageal recess is deviated to the left.\n403\nThe azygoesophageal recess is deviated to the left, indicating a shift in the mediastinal structures towards the left side. This deviation is likely due to the residual hydropneumothorax within a right upper lobe resection cavity, which has resulted in volume loss and rightward tracheal deviation. The presence of an air-filled hiatal hernia further supports this finding, as it can contribute to the displacement of the mediastinal structures. Overall, the image suggests a complex anatomical and physiological response to the surgical procedure and the resulting complications.\n404\nBased on the provided image and context, the hemidiaphragm is elevated on the right side. This is indicated by the apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with right lower lobe opacity most consistent with atelectasis. The left lung is clear, and no left pleural effusion is present. The heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable, and there is no pneumothorax. A sclerotic focus along the anterolateral right eighth rib is also noted, unchanged since the prior examination, and likely sequelae of a prior rib fracture. Clinical correlation for superimposed infection is recommended.\n405\nThe diaphragm that is elevated is the right diaphragm.\n406\nThis image is a chest radiograph, which is a type of X-ray that provides a two-dimensional representation of the chest cavity and its contents. The image is a posterior-anterior (PA) view, which is the most common type of chest radiograph. It shows the lungs, heart, and other structures in the chest cavity, as well as any abnormalities or pathologies that may be present. The image is typically taken with the patient standing up and facing the X-ray machine, with their arms at their sides and their feet shoulder-width apart. The radiographer then positions the X-ray machine to capture a PA view of the chest, which provides a clear and detailed image of the internal structures.\n407\nThe patient's gender is male.\n421\nThe chostrochondral junctions are not visible on this film because the patient is hyperinflated, as indicated by the chest being hyperinflated in the second examination. This is likely due to the patient's history of productive cough and the use of cocaine, which can lead to respiratory issues. The hyperinflation of the chest makes it difficult to visualize the chostrochondral junctions, which are typically visible on a normal chest X-ray.\n422\nUpon examining the provided image, it is evident that there is no pneumothorax present. This conclusion is based on the following observations:\n\n* The lungs appear clear, indicating no signs of consolidation or edema.\n* The heart size is normal, and the mediastinal contours are also normal.\n* There are no pleural effusions visible.\n* The absence of any pneumothorax is confirmed, as there are no signs of free air under the diaphragm.\n\nThese findings collectively support the impression that there is no acute cardiac or pulmonary process.\n430\nThe right lung is the most common location for aspirations due to its larger size and greater exposure to potential aspiration sources, such as food and liquids, during swallowing. The right lung's larger volume and proximity to the esophagus make it more susceptible to aspiration, especially in individuals with conditions like hiatal hernias or COPD, which can lead to increased risk of aspiration.\n431\nThe image shows a chest x-ray of a patient with a history of left upper lobectomy. The right hemidiaphragm is located immediately inferior to the right hemidiaphragm, and the left hemidiaphragm is elevated due to the surgery. The left lung appears normal, while the right lung shows a small area of atelectasis at the base. There is also a possible subpulmonic effusion on the right side, but no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette appears normal, and there are no signs of acute disease or complications from the surgery.\n435\nThe air under the left hemidiaphragm is likely a result of the patient's COPD and the mild overinflation of the lungs. The left midlung linear atelectasis is present, which could be contributing to the air under the hemidiaphragm. Additionally, the patient's recent hospitalization for pneumonia and the mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour may also be contributing factors. Overall, the air under the left hemidiaphragm is a normal finding in this patient's condition.\n439\nBased on the provided image and context, the hyperdensity under the diaphragm on the left is likely a small area of atelectasis or consolidation, which may be related to the patient's history of shortness of breath and cough. The absence of pleural effusions, vascular congestion, and acute focal pneumonia suggests that this finding is not a sign of pneumonia or a pneumothorax. However, further investigation with a CT scan is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any underlying conditions.\n440\nTo localize lesions on a chest X-ray (CXR), it is essential to have a prior CXR for comparison. This allows for the identification of any changes or abnormalities in the lungs, mediastinum, and other structures, enabling the radiologist to better understand the current state of the patient's chest and make more accurate diagnoses.\n\nWithout a prior CXR for comparison, it can be challenging to determine if a lesion is new or if it has changed in size, shape, or location. This is because the radiologist relies on visualizing the changes or abnormalities in the lungs, mediastinum, and other structures to make a diagnosis.\n\nIn addition to a prior CXR, other essential information that would be helpful in localizing lesions on a CXR includes:\n\n* The patient's medical history, including any previous chest problems or conditions\n* The patient's current symptoms, such as coughing, chest pain, or shortness of breath\n* The results of any other diagnostic tests\n441\nOn an x-ray, black areas typically indicate the presence of air or fluid within the lungs. The black areas are usually seen as dark shadows or opacities on the x-ray image. These shadows can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n* Consolidation: This is a sign of inflammation or infection in the lung tissue, which can appear as a dark area on an x-ray.\n* Pneumonia: This is a lung infection that can cause consolidation, leading to dark areas on an x-ray.\n* Pleural effusion: This is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which can appear as a dark area on an x-ray.\n* Pneumothorax: This is the presence of air in the pleural space, which can appear as a dark area on an x-ray.\n\nIn the provided context, the black areas on the x-ray indicate the presence of a previously-seen right lower lobe opacity, which has near-resolution. There is no new consolidation,\n445\nBased on the provided context, it is better identified on a PA CXR (Postero-Anterior Chest X-ray) that the lungs are clear, with mild bronchial wall thickening possibly due to acute or chronic bronchitis. The cardiac, hilar, and mediastinal contours are normal, and there is no pleural abnormality seen. This is because the PA CXR provides a more comprehensive view of the lungs and surrounding structures, allowing for a better assessment of lung volume, cardiac size, and mediastinal and hilar structures. In contrast, a lateral CXR may provide a more detailed view of the lung periphery and pleural surfaces, but may not offer the same level of detail in the central and mediastinal structures.\n457\nThe lesion in the image is described as having smooth, rounded borders. This characteristic is indicative of a benign process, such as a lung cyst or a benign tumor. The smooth borders are a key feature that distinguishes this lesion from more aggressive or malignant processes, which typically have irregular or jagged borders.\n469\nThe borders of the lesion are not clearly defined, as there is no visible demarcation between the normal and abnormal tissue. The lung volumes are low, causing crowding of bronchovascular structures, but no focal opacity, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is identified. The heart size is likely normal, and the mediastinal contours are normal. No rib fracture is identified.\n470\nBased on the provided image and context, the abnormality is located in the sternum, specifically a structural anomaly. This is evident from the normal cardiac, hilar, and mediastinal structures, as well as the absence of any sternal abnormalities noted at the level of the chest wall.\n472\nThe abnormality is located at the level of the chest wall, specifically around the sternum. Notably, no sternal abnormalities are noted.\n473\nThe abnormality is located in the right upper lobe, characterized by a known mass and atelectasis. The left lateral chest wall mass also remains unchanged. Additionally, an abnormal density and contour along the right hilum consistent with a known hilar mass are observed. There are emphysematous changes with relative lucency of the upper lung zones, and the heart size is within normal limits. Tortuosity of the aorta is noted.\n474\nThe abnormality is located in the right upper lobe, where there is a new opacification with air bronchograms, consistent with consolidation from pneumonia. The left lung is clear, and the right lower lobe pneumonia seen in the previous study is no longer appreciated.\n475\nThe lesion is located in the right lower lobe of the lung, as indicated by the X-ray image. The image shows a clear outline of the lung, with no visible signs of disease or abnormality in the right lower lobe. This suggests that the lesion is likely to be located in this area, and further investigation or imaging may be necessary to confirm its exact location and nature.\n485\nThe lesion is located in the right lung, specifically in the right lower lobe.\n486\nThe nodule is located in the right upper lobe, projecting over the upper lungs with areas of scarring and volume loss. Additionally, a focal nodular, most likely calcified granuloma is seen in the left upper lobe.\n487\nThe abnormality in the given image is a normal chest radiograph, with no evidence of any lung disease, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or lung nodules or masses. The lung volumes are normal, and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal, and the mediastinum and lungs are clear. This suggests that the patient does not have any underlying lung disease or other abnormalities.\n488\nThe plane seen in the image is a chest radiograph, specifically a posteroanterior (PA) view. This is evident from the orientation of the ribs and the cardiac silhouette, which is centered in the image. The PA view provides a frontal projection of the chest, allowing for the assessment of the heart, lungs, and other structures in the thoracic cavity.\n497\nThis image is taken in the anteroposterior (AP) plane, which is a standard projection used in chest radiography to evaluate the lungs and heart. The AP view provides a frontal view of the chest, allowing for the assessment of the lungs, heart, and mediastinum.\n498\nThe distribution in this image can be described as widespread ill-defined nodular opacities and bronchial wall thickening throughout both lungs, with more focal areas of opacification in the lung bases. This pattern is consistent with worsening small airways infection, as indicated by the findings of widespread nodular opacities and bronchial wall thickening, with more focal areas of opacification in the lung bases. The absence of a sizeable pleural effusion or pneumothorax further supports this interpretation.\n500\nThe image shows a chest radiograph with symmetric bilateral opacifications, most prominent in the lower lobes. This distribution is consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), although pneumonia cannot be ruled out without clinical correlation. The image also shows diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, which are likely related to a combination of elevated pulmonary venous pressure and chronic fibrosis. Given the extensive lung changes, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.\n501\nThe two bright dots in the image are likely to be the result of a radiographic artifact or a normal anatomical feature. The presence of these dots is not indicative of any pathological condition, such as lung cancer, infection, or lymphoma. The chest x-ray findings are normal, with no evidence of intrathoracic malignancy, infection, or acute cardiopulmonary disease. The comparison studies show little to no change in the patient's condition, with no evidence of pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. Therefore, the two bright dots are not a cause for concern and are likely due to a benign radiographic finding.\n502\nThe two hyperlucent inferior dots in the provided image are likely nipple shadows, as suggested by the context of the radiologic report. The report states that a nodular opacity projecting over the left lower lung is suspected to represent a nipple shadow, but a pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded. The use of nipple markers in the PA view with nipple markers is recommended to confirm the nature of these opacities.\n503\nThis film is an upright chest radiograph, as indicated by the label \"UPRIGHT\" in the top-right corner. The patient's lungs are low in volume, and there is a suggestion of mild interstitial abnormality in the right lower lung, which could be resolving edema. The cardiac size is normal, and there is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.\n505\nThe imaging modality used was a chest radiograph, specifically a PA (posteroanterior) and lateral upright chest radiograph.\n516\nThis image is a chest X-ray, specifically a posteroanterior (PA) radiograph. It is used to evaluate the lungs, heart, and mediastinum for any abnormalities or signs of disease. The image shows a normal-sized heart and mediastinum, with clear lung fields and no evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The bony thorax appears grossly intact, and there are no acute cardiac or pulmonary findings. This image is likely used to rule out infection or other intrathoracic processes in a patient presenting with left shoulder pain after a fall.\n517\nAt the base of the right lung, there is a small right apical pneumothorax and a small right pleural effusion.\n522\nThe pathology shown at the lung bases is a small amount of atelectasis at the left lung base, which may be consistent with emphysema or small airway disease/COPD. The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting COPD. There is no overt pneumonia seen. Minimal amount of left pleural effusion can potentially be present with no definitive cause for that demonstrated.\n523\nThis image is a chest radiograph, specifically a PA (posteroanterior) view, which is a standard radiographic projection used to evaluate the lungs and heart. The radiograph shows the lungs as mildly hyperinflated and clear, with no acute cardiopulmonary process or pneumonia. The heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable. The image also shows clips along the anterior mediastinum and right upper hemithorax from prior coronary artery bypass surgery and ascending aorta surgery. The impression is that there is no acute cardiopulmonary process, specifically no pneumonia, and that the lungs are consistent with emphysema.\n525\nThe two humps at the base of the image are signifying the presence of hyperinflation in the lungs, which is a characteristic feature of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The humps are likely representing the increased volume of air in the lungs due to the chronic inflammation and scarring of the airways, leading to a decrease in lung elasticity and an increase in air trapping. This is consistent with the patient's history of COPD and shortness of breath.\n526\nBlunting of the costophrenic angles indicates the presence of small bilateral effusions, which are consistent with atelectasis, but aspiration cannot be excluded.\n527\nThe blunting of the costophrenic angles indicates the presence of small bilateral effusions. This suggests that there is fluid accumulation in the pleural space, which can be caused by various factors such as heart failure, lung disease, or trauma. The blunting of the costophrenic angles is a radiographic sign that is often seen in patients with pleural effusions, and it can be used to diagnose and monitor the condition.\n528\nThe organ system visualized in the given image is the chest, specifically the lungs, heart, and mediastinum. The radiograph shows low lung volumes, a mildly enlarged heart, and widening of the superior mediastinum, which is likely due to supine positioning and low lung volumes. Additionally, there is crowding of the bronchovascular structures and a minimal patchy opacity in the left upper lung field, which may reflect an area of contusion or aspiration. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present, and no acute osseous abnormalities are detected. The impression is that the patient has low lung volumes and a patchy opacity in the left upper lung field, which is nonspecific but may reflect an area of contusion or aspiration.\n531\nThe nodules are located in the right upper lobe and left upper lobe of the lungs.\n539\nThis image is a chest X-ray, which is a medical imaging test used to visualize the lungs and heart. The X-ray was taken in a posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral upright position, providing a comprehensive view of the chest cavity. The image shows the heart, lungs, and other chest structures in detail, allowing for the assessment of any abnormalities or conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer.\n543\nThe left hemithorax appears more lucent due to the presence of multiple bilateral displaced rib fractures, which are more pronounced on the left side. This is likely caused by the patient's fall down the stairs while drunk, resulting in the fractures. The low lung volumes and widened appearance of the superior mediastinum are also contributing factors to the increased lucency in the left hemithorax.\n544\nBased on the provided image and context, the left lung lobe appears to have the least opacities, as indicated by the radiologist's report. The right lung lobe exhibits more significant opacities, with notable findings in the right apex, left midlung, and left lung base, which are concerning for multifocal pneumonia. The radiologist notes that the left lung lobe has fewer opacities compared to the right lung lobe, suggesting that the left lung lobe has less involvement or pathology.\n548\nThe diaphragm is more depressed on the left side, as indicated by the hyperinflation of the lungs and the presence of a small Morgagni hernia. The right posterior costophrenic sulcus is not imaged, but there is no pleural effusion. The heart is upper limits of normal size, and the hilar contours are normal. The left hemidiaphragmatic elevation is unchanged, and there is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The lungs are clear, and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac size is normal, and the mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The patient is status post CABG, and the lungs are hyperinflated. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax, and the right posterior costophrenic sulcus is not imaged, but there is no pleural effusion. The heart is upper limits of normal size, and the hilar contours are normal. The left hemidiaphrag\n549\nThe abnormality is located in the right lower lobe of the lung, specifically the right basal atelectasis.\n554\nThis radiograph shows a chest x-ray, which is a medical imaging test that uses X-rays to produce images of the lungs, heart, and other structures in the chest. The image provides a detailed view of the internal structures of the chest, including the lungs, heart, and bones, and is used to diagnose and monitor various conditions such as pneumonia, heart disease, and lung cancer.\n555\nThe image depicts a chest X-ray of a 42-year-old woman with lung nodule status post biopsy. The anterior wall of the right chest contains a fiducial marker, which is a small, radio-opaque marker used to guide radiation therapy. The marker is located in the right lower lobe and is surrounded by a chain suture. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other abnormalities in the chest. The left lung is clear, and there are no new cardiac or mediastinal contour abnormalities. The heart size is normal, and the mediastinum is stable. The right pleural effusion and apical thickening are unchanged, and there is no appreciable pneumothorax. Overall, the chest X-ray appears normal, with no significant abnormalities or changes noted.\n562\nThis image is a chest radiograph, which is a type of X-ray used to visualize the lungs and surrounding structures. The radiograph is taken from the front, with the patient standing upright and arms raised above their head. The image shows the lungs, heart, and other organs in the chest cavity, as well as any abnormalities such as tumors, pneumonia, or pleural effusions. The radiograph is used to assess for pleural effusion, which is a collection of fluid in the pleural space between the lungs and chest wall. The image is taken using a portable AP (anteroposterior) chest radiograph technique, which is a standard method for evaluating the chest.\n563\nThe trachea is not midline. The trachea is displaced to the right, indicating a rightward deviation of the trachea.\n564\nThe organ superimposed on the lung fields is the heart.\n565\nThe abnormality is located on the left side, as indicated by the hyperinflation and questionable increased density and lobular contours of the left hilus. This suggests potential lymphadenopathy, which is a significant finding given the patient's history of pulmonary emboli and persistent cough. The left hilar lymphadenopathy could be a sign of an underlying condition, such as lymphoma or tuberculosis, which requires further evaluation with a chest CT scan.\n567\nBased on the provided image and context, the lung with diffuse opacification is the right lung. This is evident from the radiograph showing new consolidation at the base of the right lung, which could be due to atelectasis or aspiration leading to pneumonia. The comparison to previous studies reveals a substantial amount of pleural effusion on the right, with less layering and presence of right lower lobe atelectasis. The left lung appears clear, but with low lung volumes. The overall impression suggests that the patient has a right pleural effusion, possibly with right lower lobe atelectasis, and may have a small left pleural effusion.\n569\nThe abnormal contour of the left hilum suggests a possible pathology related to the lung or mediastinum, potentially indicating a residual or recurrent mediastinal mass, which could be a result of the previous treatment for seminoma. The normal size of the heart and the absence of pleural effusions, pneumonia, or pulmonary edema further support this interpretation.\n570\nThe cystic findings in the bilateral apices are consistent with pulmonary cysts, which are a type of lung abnormality characterized by the presence of small, air-filled sacs within the lung tissue. These cysts can be caused by various factors, including genetic disorders, infections, or as a result of scarring from previous lung injuries. The presence of these cysts in the bilateral apices suggests that the patient may have a chronic lung condition, such as cystic fibrosis or pulmonary fibrosis, which can lead to the formation of these cysts over time.\n572\nBased on the provided radiographic image and context, the gender of this patient is male. This conclusion is supported by the presence of a right upper lobe mass and hilar lymphadenopathy, which are more commonly associated with male patients due to the higher incidence of lung cancer in men. Additionally, the patient's age and the description of the findings, such as the right apical opacity and loculated pleural effusion, further support this conclusion.\n576\nThe mass is located in the left lung, specifically in the left lung base, and is described as an ill-defined opacity measuring approximately 2.3 cm. This suggests that the mass may be a satellite lesion, which is a secondary tumor that has developed in a different location from the primary tumor. The mass is also associated with lymphadenopathy, which is the enlargement of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum, suggesting that the cancer has spread to these areas.\n579\nThe image is acquired in a postero-anterior (PA) orientation, which is the standard orientation for chest radiographs. This orientation allows for the evaluation of the heart, lungs, and diaphragm in a single view, providing a comprehensive assessment of the chest cavity.\n581\nThe imaging modality used in the provided context is a chest radiograph, specifically a PA (posteroanterior) and LAT (lateral) view. The radiograph is used to evaluate the lungs, heart, and mediastinum for any abnormalities or signs of disease, such as pneumonia, consolidation, or pleural effusion. The image is obtained using X-ray technology, which produces a two-dimensional representation of the internal structures of the chest cavity.\n583\nThe modality used for the given image is a chest X-ray, specifically a single supine AP view of the chest.\n590\nThe imaging modality used is a chest radiograph, which is a type of X-ray examination that provides a two-dimensional representation of the internal structures of the chest, including the lungs, heart, and mediastinum. The radiograph is taken in a frontal view, with the patient standing upright and the X-ray beam passing through the chest to capture the images.\n600\nThe right lung exhibits hyperinflation, as indicated by the radiologist's report. This is likely due to emphysema or small airways obstruction, which are common causes of hyperinflation in the lungs. The presence of a small nodule in the right lung at the intersection of the scapula and the right third anterior rib further supports this diagnosis. The lungs are otherwise clear, with no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy. The aorta is tortuous but not clearly dilated. Overall, the radiologist's impression suggests that the patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with hyperinflation, but no significant abnormalities or complications.\n604\nThis image is a chest radiograph of a 72-year-old man with a history of lung cancer and pleural effusion, taken on November 15, 2004. The radiograph shows a large left pleural effusion, with the left apex being aerated, and the right lung is clear with no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There are calcifications in the thoracic aorta visible on the radiograph. The pleural effusion has increased significantly since the prior study, and there is no evidence of mediastinal shift, indicating compensatory collapse of the left lower lobe and lingula.\n607\nThere is no evidence of a lung mass in this chest radiograph.\n609\nThe opacity located in the image is situated at the left retrocardiac region, which has been present on the prior study and appears to be less pronounced but still can potentially reflect an infectious process. Additionally, there is an increased opacification at the left base, which has a more infiltrative quality, worrisome for developing pneumonia in view of the clinical history and HIV status. The right lung remains clear.\n619\nThe trachea is not midline, as it is displaced to the right due to the presence of a right-sided opacity. This suggests that the patient may have a right-sided lung pathology, such as pneumonia or atelectasis, which is causing the trachea to be shifted to the right.\n621\nThis chest film was taken in the posteroanterior (PA) plane, which is the standard position for chest radiographs. The patient is positioned with the X-ray beam directed from the front to the back, and the image is taken from the side, resulting in a PA view.\n630\nThis radiograph is a chest radiograph, specifically a posteroanterior (PA) view. It is used to evaluate the lungs and chest cavity for various conditions such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and other abnormalities. The radiograph is taken in a standing position, with the X-ray beam directed from the front to the back of the chest, resulting in a PA view. This view is commonly used in chest radiography to assess the lungs, heart, and chest cavity for signs of disease or injury.\n632\nThe structure seen in the left hemidiaphragmatic area is most likely the left lower lobe of the lung, which appears to be slightly elevated and possibly compressed or atelectatic, suggesting volume loss. This is consistent with the impression of increased opacification at the left base in the retrocardiac region medially, which is likely due to volume loss in the left lower lobe. The sharpness of the hemidiaphragm is also raised as a possibility of some associated pleural fluid.\n635\nThe structure superimposed on the left hemidiaphragm is the heart, which is a normal anatomical relationship. The elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is likely due to the dysfunctional left hemidiaphragm, as mentioned in the report.\n636\nThe gastric bubble is located in the upper left abdomen, as indicated by the radiograph. The presence of the gastric bubble suggests that the patient has a normal anatomy and no underlying cardiopulmonary issues.\n639\nThe gastric bubble is placed in the left hemidiaphragm, as indicated by the flattening of the hemidiaphragms and the presence of the hepatic flexure of the colon below the anterior eventration of the right hemidiaphragm. This suggests that the patient has a history of hyperinflation, likely due to asthma, which is consistent with the provided context.\n640\nThis image was taken with a chest X-ray machine, specifically a PA (postero-anterior) and lateral radiograph. The image shows a normal-sized heart, normal hilar and mediastinal contours, and clear lungs without any evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusions. The image also shows a normal-sized cardiac silhouette and normal lung volumes. The image is a comparison to previous radiographs, showing no relevant change in the patient's condition.\n641\nThe three circular opacities are located in the lower lobes of the lungs, specifically in the right lower lobe and both left lower lobes. These opacities are likely to be caused by small nodules or granulomas, which are common in individuals with a history of tobacco abuse. They do not appear to be indicative of any acute cardiopulmonary disease, and their presence is consistent with the patient's history of cough and wheezing.\n644\nThe three circular opacities are located in the lower lobes of both lungs, specifically in the right and left lung bases. These opacities are likely to be a result of healed inflammatory processes, as they are no longer appreciated compared to previous studies. The remainder of the study is within normal limits, with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease, pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.\n645\nThe central venous catheter is located in the superior vena cava (SVC), specifically terminating at the mid SVC.\n646\nThe central venous catheter is placed in the right internal jugular vein, with the tip located near the cavoatrial junction. This is evident from the provided image, which shows the catheter extending into the right atrium. There is no evidence of cardiomegaly, vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.\n647\nThis chest radiograph was taken in the upright position, as indicated by the label \"NP/UPRIGHT PA\" in the upper-right corner of the image. This suggests that the patient was standing or sitting upright during the examination, rather than lying down.\n655\nThe lung fields with the most prominent ground glass opacities are the right middle lobe and the left lower lobe, as indicated by the increased opacification and poor definition of the heart border. This is consistent with the previous CT scan findings of bronchiectasis and interstitial markings. The ill-defined peribronchial opacities in the left lower lobe may suggest a recent flare of bronchial inflammation. Further clinical correlation is required to confirm this diagnosis.\n657\nThis chest radiograph was taken in the postero-anterior (PA) position, which is a standard technique used to capture a clear image of the lungs and surrounding structures. The patient was positioned with their back against the X-ray plate and their chest centered, with their arms raised above their head to avoid any overlap or obstruction. The X-ray beam was then directed from the front of the patient to the back, resulting in a clear image of the lungs, heart, and mediastinum.\n671\nThe pathology is located on the right side of the body, specifically in the pleural space, and is characterized as a moderate-sized effusion. This effusion has resulted in substantial volume loss of the right middle and lower lobe, with the left lung remaining clear. The presence of an azygos fissure is noted. The impression is that there is a new moderate right-sided effusion with substantial volume loss of the right middle and lower lobe, and superimposed infection cannot be excluded.\n672\nBased on the provided context, the pathology is likely a malignant pleural effusion, which is a common complication of pancreatic cancer. The presence of a right-sided PICC line with the tip in the low SVC and the improvement in the right upper lobe and parahilar opacity suggest that the patient has been receiving treatment for the cancer. The persistent pleural effusions indicate that the cancer has spread to the pleura, which is a common site for metastasis in pancreatic cancer. The presence of bibasal atelectasis and interstitial edema suggests that the patient has developed pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema, which are common in patients with advanced cancer. The use of a PICC line and the presence of a right-sided pleural effusion suggest that the patient has been receiving intravenous therapy, which is a common treatment for malignant pleural effusions. Overall, the pathology is likely a malignant pleural effusion, which is a common complication of pancreatic cancer.\n673\nThe image shows a chest radiograph of a patient with a right lung abscess, characterized by a large right pleural effusion, partially fissural, which has increased in volume since the previous radiograph. The left lung is clear, and there is no left pleural effusion. The heart size is normal, and there is severe lymphadenopathy in the right lower paratracheal region of the mediastinum, causing leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet.\n\nThis image suggests that the patient has a significant respiratory issue, likely related to the lung abscess and pleural effusion, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms and potentially life-threatening complications.\n674\nBased on the provided image and context, the pathology seen is a moderate to large right pleural effusion, partially fissural, which has continued to enlarge as noted in the report of the previous chest radiograph. The left lung is clear and there is no left pleural effusion. The heart size is normal, and there is fullness in the right lower paratracheal region of the mediastinum and leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet due to severe lymphadenopathy seen on the chest CT dated. The findings are consistent with a right-sided pleural effusion, possibly due to lymphatic obstruction or other causes, and the left lung is clear.\n675\nThe pathology is located on the right side of the body, as indicated by the presence of a large right pleural effusion and volume loss in the right middle and lower lobe. The left lung is clear, and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia. The right-sided effusion and volume loss are likely due to the patient's cryptogenic cirrhosis and volume overload.\n676\nThe pathology is located on the right side, specifically in the right lower lung zone, as indicated by the spiculated lesion/scar that has decreased in size over time. The associated right-sided effusion or pleural thickening suggests that the pathology may be related to a pleural effusion or pleural thickening. The adjacent right middle and lower lobe atelectatic changes further support this finding. In contrast, the left lung is clear, indicating that the pathology is localized to the right side.\n677\nThe abnormality in the image is located in the right lower lobe of the lung, as indicated by the basal opacity. This finding is consistent across all the reports provided, suggesting a chronic condition rather than an acute process. The presence of this opacity is unchanged since the previous examination, ruling out any new abnormalities or acute processes.\n686\nThe abnormality in this image is located in the left lung, specifically in the left lower lobe. The image shows a known left-sided lung mass that has undergone mild interval growth, indicating a possible increase in size or severity of the lung cancer. Additionally, there are minimal interstitial abnormalities on the right, associated with a mild degree of pleural thickening, which may suggest some degree of lung disease or scarring. The moderate tortuosity of the descending aorta and mild enlargement of the left hilus are also noted, but these findings are not considered abnormal. Overall, the image suggests that the patient has a known lung cancer that is being monitored for changes in size or severity.\n687\nThe image is concerning for left upper lobe pneumonia, which has worsened since the prior study from 2 days ago. The right lung base atelectasis has improved, and there is no repair. Additionally, pulmonary edema is present. Furthermore, severe cardiomegaly is stable, and there are no large pleural effusions.\n697\nBased on the provided image and context, the lung pathology concerning is a focal parenchymal opacity at the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe, which could represent pneumonia. Additionally, there is mild pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly. The left pleural effusion and partial left lower lobe atelectasis are also noted. The lung volumes are normal, and there is no pneumothorax. The image suggests that the patient may have pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis, but further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.\n698\nThe soft-tissue density seen in this image contains a pericardial cyst, which is a normal anatomical structure. The pericardial cyst is a small, fluid-filled sac that is located in the pericardium, the sac that surrounds the heart. It is a normal finding and does not indicate any disease or abnormality.\n701\nThe soft-tissue density in this image is due to a breast implant.\n702\nThe right heart border is obscured due to the elevated right lung base, which may be caused by a right subpulmonic pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is not visible, indicating that the pleural effusion is likely compressing the right heart border. This is a common finding in patients with pleural effusion, as the fluid accumulates in the pleural space and can push the heart away from the chest wall.\n709\nThe right heart border appears normal, with no visible abnormalities or signs of cardiac enlargement. The mediastinum is also unremarkable, indicating no significant abnormalities in the mediastinal structures. The lung volumes are low, which may contribute to an exaggerated cardiac silhouette, but the heart size is within normal limits. Overall, the radiograph suggests a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette.\n710\nUpon careful examination of the provided image, it is evident that the air under the diaphragm is situated on the left side. This conclusion is based on the observation of the diaphragmatic silhouette, which appears to be more prominent on the left side compared to the right. The presence of air under the diaphragm is a common finding in normal individuals and is not typically associated with any specific pathology. However, it is essential to note that this finding should be interpreted in conjunction with the overall radiographic appearance of the chest and abdomen, as well as any clinical information provided.\n713\nBased on the provided images and context, it is evident that the right lung exhibits a higher density of markings compared to the left lung. This observation is consistent across all the images, including the PA and lateral views, as well as the comparison with previous radiographs. The presence of these markings suggests that the right lung is more affected by the underlying condition, which is not further specified in the provided information.\n715\nBased on the provided image and context, the most lung markings are located in the lower lobes of both lungs. The lungs appear to be fully expanded and clear of any significant abnormalities, with the exception of a small linear band of atelectasis or scarring in the left lower lobe. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are also normal, and there is no pleural abnormality. The aortopulmonic window is slightly effaced, but this is considered a long-standing feature and not clinically significant. Overall, the lungs appear to be clear of any acute or chronic lung disease.\n716\nThe test or procedure that might reveal the diagnosis is a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. This imaging modality can provide a more detailed examination of the lungs, mediastinum, and other structures in the chest, which can help identify any abnormalities that may not be visible on a chest radiograph. Additionally, a CT scan can be used to assess for pulmonary embolism, which is a common cause of chest pain and shortness of breath.\n717\nTo get to a diagnosis, the radiologist should perform a thorough analysis of the chest radiograph, taking into account the patient's symptoms and medical history. The radiologist should look for any abnormalities in the lungs, heart, and mediastinum, such as consolidation, effusion, or masses. They should also assess the cardiac silhouette, mediastinal and hilar structures, and lung parenchyma for any signs of acute or chronic cardiopulmonary processes. Additionally, the radiologist should compare the current radiograph with any previous studies to identify any changes or abnormalities. Based on the findings, the radiologist can provide an impression of the patient's condition and help guide further diagnostic testing or treatment.\n718\nTo determine cardiomegaly, we look for an enlarged cardiac silhouette or heart size, which can be assessed by comparing the cardiac size to the surrounding structures, such as the thoracic spine and the lungs. In this image, the cardiac silhouette appears at the upper limits of normal in size. The cardiac borders are smooth and well-defined, with no signs of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. The aorta appears very mildly tortuous, and there is a mild interstitial abnormality suggesting vascular congestion but no focal opacification. These findings suggest mild cardiomegaly.\n721\nTo determine if the heart is enlarged, we can look at the provided image and context. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size, and there is no evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. The heart appears to be within normal limits, but this may be due to the AP portable technique used. Overall, the heart appears to be at the upper limits of normal in size.\n722\nThe \"tram-track\"-ing indication in this context refers to a radiographic finding characterized by linear or branching opacities within the lungs, resembling railroad tracks. This pattern is often seen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly when they are in an upright position. The linear opacities are thought to represent airway walls and their associated vessels, which become more prominent due to the chronic inflammation and airway dilation typical of COPD. In the provided image, the mention of \"no acute cardiopulmonary process\" and the absence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax supports the conclusion that the tram-track appearance is consistent with COPD, given the context of chest pain after a recent stent procedure.\n723\nThe image depicts a chest radiograph, which is a medical imaging test used to visualize the lungs and heart. The radiograph shows a normal-sized heart and lungs, with no signs of pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is also normal in size. There are no visible abnormalities in the mediastinum or hilar regions. The image suggests that the patient does not have any acute cardiopulmonary issues.\n724\nThe presence of a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and a small right pleural effusion, as indicated by the chest radiograph, suggests that the patient has pleural effusions. The enlarged heart and calcified lymph nodes in the right hilum are also visible on the radiograph. The lungs are well expanded and clear, with no focal consolidations or pneumothorax. The left-sided double-lumen dialysis catheter is visible with the tip in the right atrium. The impression is that there is a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and a small right pleural effusion.\n729\nA pleural effusion is a collection of fluid in the pleural space, which is the area between the lungs and the chest wall. This can occur due to various reasons such as heart failure, pneumonia, or cancer. The provided chest radiograph shows a significant reduction in the pleural effusion after the insertion of a pigtail catheter at the right base, indicating effective drainage of the fluid. However, a small residual effusion is still present, and some basilar atelectasis is seen. The left lung remains clear, and there is no evidence of a pneumothorax. Overall, the impression suggests a reduced effusion with some residual fluid and atelectasis, but no new parenchymal opacities or signs of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.\n730\nThe trachea in this image is deviating to the left, above the level of the clavicle, which could be due to an enlarged right lobe of the thyroid or another mediastinal lesion.\n731\nBased on the provided image and context, the pathology appears to be a lung contusion or possibly a pneumothorax (PTx) following blunt trauma to the right chest, accompanied by right-sided pleurisy. The presence of mild hyperexpansion of the lungs, without acute cardiopulmonary disease, pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion, supports this diagnosis. The absence of significant change between studies suggests a chronic condition, such as chronic pulmonary disease, with the current findings consistent with a lung contusion or PTx.\n733\nThe abnormality in this image is a trace left apical pneumothorax, which is unchanged compared to the prior exam. There are no focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia identified. The heart size is normal, and the hilar and mediastinal contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion, and the visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.\n734\nBased on the provided image, the foreign body appears to be a small, round, and darkly outlined object located in the upper right chest area. The object is situated between the lung and the pleura, suggesting that it is a foreign body lodged in the pleural space. The object's size and shape are consistent with a small stone or a piece of bone that has been aspirated into the lungs.\n735\nBased on the provided image and context, the foreign body in question is a linear, metallic object located in the right mid lung field. This object is likely a surgical clip or a piece of surgical material that was left behind during a previous surgical procedure. The object's presence is consistent with the patient's history of a surgical procedure and the absence of any other acute cardiothoracic process.\n736\nThe pathology in the given image is a normal chest radiograph, with no evidence of acute disease. The lung volumes are normal, and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart appears normal in size, and the mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There are no other lung parenchymal processes of acute or chronic origin. The only notable finding is a soft tissue density 1-cm lung nodule in the right lung apex, which needs to be further evaluated by CT.\n743\nThe abnormality in this image is the presence of a small, well-defined, rounded mass in the right upper lobe, which is suggestive of a granuloma. The mass is surrounded by a halo of lucency, indicating that it is not a solid tumor but rather a collection of inflammatory cells. The mass is located in the right upper lobe, which is a common location for granulomas to form. The presence of this mass suggests that the patient has a history of pancreatitis and may be at risk for developing further complications.\n744\nThe densities in both mid-lung fields are consistent with the pre-existing right upper lobe pneumonia, which has only minimally decreased. The lungs elsewhere are unremarkable, and there is no evidence of central lymph node enlargement. The heart size is normal, and the left pleural surface is unremarkable.\n747\nThe densities in the lung fields represent recurrent right middle lobe opacity, which may be due to scarring and superimposed soft tissue, but also cannot exclude pneumonia. The hyperinflated lungs without focal consolidation, large effusion, or pneumothorax suggest a possible chronic condition, while the normal cardiomediastinal silhouette and intact bony structures indicate no acute complications. The rounded density projecting over the anterior right second rib was not seen on the previous examination, suggesting it may be outside the patient's body. The findings are highly suspicious for an infectious process, potentially fungal or bacterial in origin, and require further evaluation and correlation with clinical examination.\n748\nThe pulmonary nodules are located in the right lung, specifically in the upper lobe.\n749\nThe nodules are located in the lungs, specifically in the right upper lobe, and are described as ill-defined with air bronchograms and a slightly rounded shape. They are best seen on the frontal radiograph and are located in the same area where a rounded opacity was present in a previous study. The nodules are not further characterized, but they are mentioned as a possible differential diagnosis for an area of consolidation in the middle lobe.\n750\nThe lesions in the image are indicative of moderate cardiomegaly, with the heart size being borderline, and cephalization of pulmonary vasculature, reflecting elevated left atrial pressure. There is no evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion. The lungs are well-expanded and essentially clear, aside from right apical scarring. The mediastinal fat partially obscures the apex of a mildly to moderately enlarged heart, and atherosclerotic calcification is present in the knob and descending regions of a normal size thoracic aorta. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The lungs are well-expanded and essentially clear, aside from right apical scarring. Cephalization of pulmonary vasculature reflects elevated left atrial pressure. The findings suggest that the patient has a history of asthma and cough, with exp wheezin but no focality on exam. The impression is that there is no acute cardiopulmonary disease\n753\nThe lesions in the image are consistent with interstitial abnormality, which can be a reflection of prior episodes of pulmonary edema, cigarette smoking, or asthma. There is no overt pulmonary edema, consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.\n754\nThe lesions are located in the lung fields, specifically in the lower lobe on the lateral view, and are characterized by bibasilar atelectasis. This suggests that the lesions are situated in the lower parts of the lungs, which are responsible for gas exchange and oxygenation of the blood. The presence of atelectasis, which is the collapse or closure of a part of the lung, indicates that the lesions may be causing some obstruction or blockage in the airways, leading to reduced lung volume and impaired gas exchange.\n755\nThe lesions are located in the left lung, specifically in the lower lobe, with a small area of consolidation. The consolidation is not well-defined and does not appear to be a typical pneumonia. The heart is normal in size, and there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. The lungs are clear, and the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The lungs are clear, and the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The lungs are clear, and the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.\n756\nThe pathology seen in the image is a diffuse nodular opacification in both lungs, most likely related to widespread metastatic disease. The presence of more focal opacity in the right lung base could reflect an area of developing infection. Additionally, there is evidence of mild pulmonary vascular congestion and gaseous distention of colonic loops of bowel in the left upper quadrant. The patient's history of chronic bronchiectasis and relapsed refractory secondary AML, as well as their current presentation of increasing shortness of breath and new oxygen requirement, supports this diagnosis. Further evaluation and correlation with previous imaging or history of malignancy are recommended to confirm the diagnosis.\n757\nBased on the provided image and context, the pathology seen is a diffuse airspace opacification in both lungs, suggestive of widespread multifocal pneumonia. The presence of multiple pulmonary nodules and the patient's history of bladder cancer and osteosarcoma, along with the recent history of adenovirus and CMV colitis, further support this diagnosis. The imaging findings are consistent with an infectious process, potentially fungal or bacterial in origin, given the patient's compromised immune status and the absence of other complications such as pleural effusions or pulmonary edema.\n758\nThe pathology seen above is a right-sided pleural effusion with bibasal atelectasis, consistent with the patient's history of pancreatic cancer and pleural effusion likely malignant. The right upper lobe and parahilar opacity have decreased in extent, but a masslike area of opacification remains surrounding the right hilum. Asymmetric interstitial edema has also decreased, and moderate right and small left pleural effusions are present. There is no pneumothorax. The findings are consistent with the patient's history of metastatic small cell lung cancer with mets to L2 spine and s/p laminectomy. The right-sided PICC line with the tip in the low SVC is also noted.\n759\nThe abnormality seen in this image is a persistent, stable right pleural effusion with adjacent right lower and middle lobe relaxation atelectasis. The left pleural effusion has decreased substantially, and there is no pneumothorax. The right lower lobe collapse has improved slightly, and the left lung is clear. The cardiac silhouette is borderline in size without evidence of pulmonary edema. The aortic contours are normal. There is no focal lung consolidation elsewhere. The right pleural effusion has decreased substantially, and there is no pneumothorax. The right lower lobe collapse has improved slightly, and the left lung is clear. The cardiac silhouette is borderline in size without evidence of pulmonary edema. The aortic contours are normal. There is no focal lung consolidation elsewhere.\n760\nThe organ system shown in the image is the cardiorespiratory system, specifically focusing on the chest cavity and its contents. The image provides a detailed view of the heart, lungs, and surrounding structures, including the mediastinum, diaphragm, and ribcage. The radiograph also reveals the presence of a lytic lesion along the anterior lateral fourth rib, which may indicate a post-traumatic or soft tissue mass. Additionally, the image shows a prominent epicardial fat pad and an expansile lytic area along the left fourth rib with adjacent pulmonary parenchymal reaction. The lungs appear clear, and there is no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. The image also shows a central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction, a normal-sized heart, and clear lungs. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits, and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The right hemidiaphragm remains\n763\nThe image shows a chest X-ray, which is part of the organ system responsible for respiration, circulation, and the immune system. The context provided includes various examinations and findings related to the chest and lungs, with indications such as fever, neutropenia, and a history of leukemia. The techniques used include chest radiographs in different positions (PA and lateral), semi-upright AP, and lateral views. The findings include a normal-sized heart, clear lungs, and no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. However, there are some abnormalities noted, such as a right-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip in the cavoatrial junction, low lung volumes, and minimal atelectasis at the lung bases. Additionally, there are lytic expansile lesions within the ribs and compression deformities of the thoracic and lumbar spines, which are consistent with known multiple myeloma. Overall, the image suggests that the patient has a history of cancer and is\n764\nThe patient was positioned supine when this image was taken. This is evident from the fact that the lungs are hyperexpanded and the mediastinum appears normal, which is consistent with a supine position. Additionally, the presence of a Port-A-Cath over the right axilla and the absence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax further supports this interpretation.\n765\nThe patient is in a supine position for this image.\n766\nThe presence of a clear lung appearance, normal cardiomediastinal contours, and the absence of any focal consolidations or vascular congestion indicate that there is no pleural effusion present.\n767\nThe absence of a pleural effusion is determined by the presence of sharp costal margins, which are the edges of the ribs. This is evident in the provided image, where the costal margins are clearly visible and not obscured by an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. The sharp costal margins indicate that there is no significant pleural effusion present.\n768\nThe provided image is a chest radiograph that shows a right pleural effusion and volume loss at the right base, with mediastinal shift to the right. There is also an area of heterogeneous opacification in the right mid zone, which is concerning for developing pneumonia in a patient with severe chronic pulmonary disease. The left lung is clear, and there is no large pneumothorax. The patient has a history of right pleural effusion and volume loss at the right base, with mediastinal shift to the right, and an area of heterogeneous opacification in the right mid zone, which is consistent with pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis. The overall findings are concerning for pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage, and clinical correlation is advised.\n773\nThe observed sign of pulmonary consolidation on the right side is most likely pneumonia, given the new opacification in the right lung and the presence of a pleurex catheter in the right hemithorax. The unchanged opacification of the right apex is consistent with known lung carcinoma, while the slightly increased opacification of the right hemithorax and volume loss suggest a possible complication such as pneumonia. The new soft tissue calcifications in the region of the right scapula are not visualized on prior chest radiographs and may be external to the patient or palpable on exam.\n774\nThe radiograph shows a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette, with no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema. The lungs are clear without any abnormalities.\n775\nOne abnormality that can be seen in the image is a left upper lobe calcified granuloma, which is unchanged in size.\n776\nThe abnormality visible in the image is a consolidation in the right upper lobe, consistent with pneumonia. This is indicated by the presence of air bronchograms and the lack of a clear boundary between the consolidated area and the surrounding lung tissue. The consolidation is located in the right upper lobe and is accompanied by air bronchograms, which are a characteristic feature of pneumonia. The absence of a clear boundary between the consolidated area and the surrounding lung tissue suggests that the pneumonia is likely to be located in the right upper lobe. The presence of air bronchograms further supports this conclusion. Overall, the image suggests that the patient has pneumonia in the right upper lobe, which is a common location for this condition.\n777\nBased on the provided image and context, the findings are relatively stable, with no pneumothorax or other significant changes since the prior CXR from yesterday. The comparison is made to the previous study, showing a similar appearance of the large right upper lobe mass. The feeding tube has been removed, and the mass in the right upper lobe is stable in appearance. New partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe is noted, while the left lung and cardiac silhouette are unremarkable. The opacity in the right upper lobe is possibly reflecting hemorrhage given recent biopsy. No pneumothorax is seen. The final impression is that the right upper lobe pneumonia has only minimally decreased, and the pneumonia is still extensive, continuing to be clearly visualized in the right upper lobe.\n778\nThe aortic area appears normal, with no visible abnormalities or signs of pathology. The mediastinal contours are also normal, and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax present. The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema, and the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no free air under the diaphragm, and the heart size is normal. Overall, the radiograph suggests that there is no acute cardiopulmonary process or significant pathology in the aortic area.\n783\nThe pathology shown in the aorta is a tortuous and calcified aorta, which is a common finding in individuals with sickle cell disease. The aorta is also moderately enlarged, which may be related to the patient's history of sickle cell crisis and altered mental status. The retrocardiac opacity is likely due to a hiatal hernia, tortuous aorta, or aneurysm, although other etiologies such as atelectasis are also possible. The lungs are otherwise clear, and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is moderately enlarged, and there are calcified densities in the left apex. Overall, the findings suggest that the patient has a complex cardiac and pulmonary pathology that requires further evaluation and management.\n784\nUpon examining the provided image, it is evident that there are seven ribs superimposed on the lung fields. This observation is based on the typical anatomy of the ribcage, where each rib is positioned to enclose and protect the lungs. The superimposition of ribs on the lung fields is a normal anatomical feature and does not indicate any pathology.\n787\nBased on the provided image, there are 10 visible ribs in vertical order on this chest radiograph.\n788\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_context['llama_3_2-VI query_RAG response']=responses\ndf_context.to_csv('/kaggle/working/Query_RAG_VQA_RAD_LLama_3_2.csv', index=False)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-12T14:12:54.950090Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-12T14:12:54.950335Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-12T14:12:55.012364Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-12T14:12:54.950317Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-12T14:12:55.011844Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df['llama_3_2-VI response'] = responses\ndf.to_csv('/kaggle/working/Vanilla_VQA_RAD_LLama_3_2.csv', index=False)\ndf","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-11T16:29:10.998609Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-11T16:29:10.998781Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-11T16:29:11.045728Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-11T16:29:10.998768Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-11T16:29:11.045034Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":15,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"     QID_unique       QID_para                            QID_linked  \\\n2             3       freeform  0e90b6bc-265f-490b-a039-509b9907a3cb   \n4             5       freeform  2415ba3a-3044-4d68-a99f-21249b892970   \n9            11       freeform  4a7dc511-9573-4844-a8ee-f9a1338cce7d   \n13           19  test_freeform  9086a298-c1f4-44fb-ad69-772a30c4e97e   \n17           26       freeform  aec9c376-6ef2-45ed-b2c4-304d3a7211ff   \n..          ...            ...                                   ...   \n777        2207           para  ad7e46a5-9ba4-4944-a6d8-f4f4e5ec3b55   \n782        2216       freeform  0977d9bc-3a52-4f47-aef5-fc666ad767ca   \n783        2217           para  0977d9bc-3a52-4f47-aef5-fc666ad767ca   \n786        2234       freeform  0fb2a629-6e78-4d38-b8b4-c61188cf8c80   \n787        2235           para  0fb2a629-6e78-4d38-b8b4-c61188cf8c80   \n\n                                          IMAGEID_case  \\\n2    https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/case?id=19aa8a2b-35...   \n4    https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/case?id=19aa8a2b-35...   \n9    https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/case?id=31ac9c0f-73...   \n13   https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/case?id=b197277b-69...   \n17   https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/case?id=31ac9c0f-73...   \n..                                                 ...   \n777  https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/case?id=6383bee2-63...   \n782  https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/case?id=1440422f-8d...   \n783  https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/case?id=1440422f-8d...   \n786  https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/case?id=f5a96a39-af...   \n787  https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/case?id=f5a96a39-af...   \n\n                                               IMAGEID IMAGEORGAN  \\\n2    https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/images/full/synpic2...
